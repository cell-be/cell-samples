When upgrading do not delete your old version, it will delete any savegames you've made. Just choose install package, when it tells you the current version is already installed just tell it to install anyway.

Aside from the lack of an interface, I think these are starting to work really well.

Release 3
 -Settings are remembered between sessions
 -Option to underscan output, up to 10% for nestopia and 50% for gambatte
 -Option to enable Vsync and Linear Filtering(to reduce scaling artifacts, in exchange for blurriness)
 -Maybe fixed sound, maybe not

Release 2
 -Added great NES icon from fraser0206 at psx-scene, thanks
 -Save games and save states in nestopia
 -Fast Forward, Hold R2 to go at 4x speed
 -Fixed the Exit Game option from the PS3 menu, it no longer restarts the system
 -File list tweaks, removed the . and .. entries(use Circle to go up a directory). Holding cross no longer trys
  to down more than one directory.
 -VSync is still disabled


Controls
 In the file menu Cross selects an item, Circle goes to the previous directory
 In game, press right stick to open settings menu, circle to exit menu
 Press L3 + L1 to save state, L3 + R1 to load
 Press L2 to fast forward
